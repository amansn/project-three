# Project 3
by Aman Nagpal, Jonathan Schupak & Matthew Jaikaran

For our project, we designed a web app called delivery&chill. This app is perfect for those nights when you want to stay in, order food, and watch something online, but you don't know what you want to watch or eat. This is the ultimate night-in tool for those who are just too indecisive.

Once you enter your location, the app displays a random restaurant from Delivery.com that deliverys to your address, and provides information such as rating and cuisine. It also displays a random movie from the Guidebox API. There are next and previous arrows next to both the restaurant and movie displays in case you would like to switch to a different option.

When you are happy with your selection, you can hit the order button for the restaurant and select a streaming or purchase source for the movie.

### Future Goals
Our original goal was to create a 'Perfect Night Out' web app in addition to the night in. We started working with the SeatGeek API to get events in the area, which we would then couple with a restaurant and/or bar selection. This would be a next great step to offer more functionality for the site.
